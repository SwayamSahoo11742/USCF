Task specifications

Write a function for a specific social media. Twitter would be: def twitter_analysis(CompanyName), where CompanyName is a string

The function should be able to:

		Use appropriate APIs or web scraping to get the number of mentions + a few posts' contents mentioning CompanyName (ideally have posts from last 5 days)
		Save number of mentions on Supabase - No specific saving method ATM, we will standardize later
		Use TextBlob to get sentiment, save as a score from 0-100
		Save sentiment for each days seperately on Supabase as well

Think of this function as the first time a company signs up. 
You go through their history and give them data! Obviously free APIs have limitations so do the longest time frame you can or optimal code. Also if you reach API limit just move on you don't have to make the code wait 15 minutes to get your calls resetÂ
